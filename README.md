# 🧪 Welcome to the ClearRoute Tech Tests 

We appreciate tech tests can often be daunting, too specific, or un-relevant. To address this, we have tried to make these tests relevant to real-world situations and engagements that our QCEs may face every day.  

We know this is a little different to normal, so please, feel free to feedback to us on anything! Have fun!
